What does this mean for coding, testing, architecture and design, and other important aspects of our work?

From tech portals to morning news shows and gossip sites, everyone is trying to predict the future impact of this game-changing technology. One key concern is whether AI will take over jobs currently performed by humans. Some experts predict that this will indeed be the case, with AI handling routine tasks and freeing up humans to focus on more creative and strategic work. Others worry that AI will lead to widespread job loss and economic disruption.</p><p>In this session, we will explore the current state of AI technology and examine its sources of information to determine the reliability of its decisions and predictions. Using DATEV eG, a leading German technology company, as an example, we will demonstrate how the knowledge which AI possess can be integrated into a company's procedures.
