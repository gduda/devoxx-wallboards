Even languages that we think we know (looking at you, JavaScript) turn out to have some interesting ideas and concepts buried away inside them that seem to be the sole province of the \"master\" developer. But strangely enough, none of these \"new\" languages are actually all that new. Most of them are a small step on top of older languages that have been around for decades. And, it turns out, if you understand some of these \"influencer\" languages, you understand what the influence is--well beyond your current language, in fact.<br>This is the province of the historian: Studying the past to understand the future.

In this presentation, we demo how hackers and red teamers are using AI to their advantage.<br>1 What is AI<br>We will explore how AI models are trained, including looking at the most common training set, the ‘Common Crawl Database’ and why generative AI can consume trash, yet still sound convincing in their answers. We will also dive into the different types of AI such as LLMs vs generative AI, predictive AI, and contextual AI. <br>2 AI in the wrong hands<br>We show how malicious actors can use AI tools for nefarious activities including abusing AI dependency hallucinations, data poising, and using prompt injection to get to the hidden treasures of an AI model. We also look at the concerns of open-source AI models which can be adapted to give script kiddies super powers.&nbsp;<br>3 Using AI safely&nbsp;<br>During this section, we will discuss some of the many ways AI can be used to help developers without destroying security <br>4 Conclusion<br>AI is neither good nor bad, but it is here to stay. By reviewing how malicious actors use AI, the risks that come with it, and the benefits it brings, this survival guide will help any developer, hacker or defending build for and with AI.
