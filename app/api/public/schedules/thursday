These abstractions reflect our mental model of a software system, which are useful when describing our architectural ideas and intent. These same abstractions don't typically exist in the programming languages we use though. There's no \"layer\" keyword in Java, for example. To implement these abstractions, we need to use a combination of the constructs available in our programming languages; such as classes, interfaces, objects, functions, packages, namespaces, files, and folders.

This presentation explores the potential of LLMs to revolutionize software development by examining the extent to which they can automate the coding process. Using Gemini Code Assist, a cutting-edge LLM-powered coding assistant, we delve into real-world case studies to assess its effectiveness in generating functional, efficient, and secure code.<br>We analyze the strengths and limitations of Gemini Code Assist in different scenarios, ranging from simple tasks to complex projects. Through a series of practical examples, we showcase how Gemini Code Assist can significantly enhance developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks, providing intelligent code suggestions, and even generating entire code snippets.<br>However, we also acknowledge the challenges and potential risks associated with relying solely on LLMs for code generation. We discuss the importance of human oversight, the need for robust validation mechanisms, and the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in software development.<br>By the end of this presentation, attendees will gain a deeper understanding of the current state of LLMs in code generation, the potential benefits and drawbacks of using tools like Gemini Code Assist, and the future trajectory of AI-powered software development.","summary":"The presentation explores Large Language Models' (LLMs) potential in software development and coding automation, using Gemini Code Assist.
