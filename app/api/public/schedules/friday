A memory leak issue was encountered in a Java application deployed in GKE after its migration from on-premises to the cloud. This issue caused the application to gradually consume more and more memory over time, leading to decreases in performance and crashes. The root cause of the problem was traced outside of the JVM memory management, to the way memory is allocated inside the Standard C library and the size of malloc arenas. To troubleshoot this issue, the steps described in Brice Dutheil's articles \"Off-heap memory reconnaissance\" and \"Handling native memory fragmentation of glibc\" were followed.
